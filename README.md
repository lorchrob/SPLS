# SPLS
# How to use
There are two major components to this code-- finding all the SPLS(3, 2)s, and applying the SPLS sieve to find representative examples for orbits. To find all the SPLS(3, 2)s, run Spls32All.java (in src folder). To apply the sieve, run projectScript.m (you must run Spls32All.java before doing this).
