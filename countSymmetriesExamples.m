%{
NOTE: Must run 'readSpls32s' first!

Purpose:
  * Counts the number of essentially "unique" variants
    of each spls32 by applying 128 operations and seeing if the resulting
    spls32s are relabelings (applies these 128 operations to each spls32)

Parameters:
  * spls32s, a 3d array of all spls32s

Returns:
  * counts, an array of the unique symmetries of all the spls32s (first
    count applies to first spls32, etc.)
